\section{Questions}
\subsection{How many weeks did you attend the internship}
\begin{itemize}
    \item I have attended 4 weeks.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{How many (approx) hours did you spend on all activities related to the internship}
\begin{itemize}
    \item I was giving 3-4 hours per day.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{What did you learn throughout the course of the internship}
\begin{itemize}
    \item This opportunity had opened door for me  to explore new domain in finance with programming which is something new to me as being a computer science background i never heard from my seniors that they ever worked in fiance,Overall this internship showed me a new path in trading which is worth it learning.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{What do you think can be improved in the Internship}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Assuming interns are new to python, I highly recommend using VS code.It has very good extensions and it also supports Jupyter Notebook.The extensions you install helps alot in debugging the issues.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Based on the Stipend Table above please create a new table for yourself}

\section{Final Project}
I will give an overview of the project in sequence followed in the document.
\subsection{Download minute resolution data of NVDA for the past 60 days from Yahoo Finance}
\begin{itemize}
    \item When I tried to download minute resolution data it did throw me an error"Only 7 days worth of 1m granularity data are allowed to be fetched per request."
    \item For that I was only able to fetch 1-day data so I fetch past 200 days.
    \item For computing the SMA I used \textbf{Adj Close} column because it gives more accurate answers.

\subsection{ performance metrics of strategies 1 and 2}

    \caption{Performance Metrics}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|p{9cm}|}
        \hline
      \textbf{Total Return}&Strategy 2 (0.5546) has a higher total return than Strategy 1 (0.4783), which suggests that Strategy 2 has generated more profit over the specified time period. \\ %end of row
       \hline %creating the row line at top
        \textbf{Annualized Return}&Strategy 2 (1.7889) also has a higher annualized return than Strategy 1 (1.4225). This means that, on average, Strategy 2 has produced greater returns per year compared to Strategy 1. \\ %end of row
       \hline %creating the row line at top
        \textbf{Sharpe Ratio}&Strategy 2 (2.1824) has a higher Sharpe ratio than Strategy 1 (1.8385), indicating that Strategy 2 has provided a better risk-adjusted return, considering the volatility of the returns. \\ %end of row
       \hline %creating the row line at top
        \textbf{Maximum Drawdown}&Both strategies have experienced drawdowns, with Strategy 2 having a slightly larger maximum drawdown (-0.5165) compared to Strategy 1 (-0.4528). A lower maximum drawdown is generally preferred, as it signifies a smaller decline from the peak portfolio value. \\ %end of row
       \hline %creating the row line at top
        \textbf{Number of Trades}&Strategy 1 (7.5) has a higher number of trades than Strategy 2 (1.5). This suggests that Strategy 1 is more active, potentially resulting in higher transaction costs and more frequent adjustments to the portfolio. \\ %end of row
       \hline %creating the row line at top
        \textbf{Win Rate}&Both strategies have relatively similar win rates, with Strategy 1 (0.4234) having a slightly higher win rate than Strategy 2 (0.4161). \\ %end of row

    \subsection{Evaluation of Strategy 1 and 2}
    \begin{figure}[h]

\textbf{Conclusion:}
\par{\newline Strategy 2 has performed better than Strategy 1 in terms of total return, annualized return, Sharpe ratio, and maximum draw down.
\par\newline However, it's important to consider the context, market conditions, and other relevant factors when making a decision. A higher return doesn't always imply a better strategy, especially if it comes with significantly higher risk or other limitations. It's advisable to analyze these metrics alongside other relevant information before making any investment decisions.}
